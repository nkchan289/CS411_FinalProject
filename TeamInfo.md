## Project Summary

The project is an app that helps people evaluate the livability of different areas across the United States, based on key socioeconomic factors and user input. On our website, users can input their preferences—such as priorities on housing affordability, job opportunities, population trends, or GDP growth—and the app will generate personalized recommendations of suitable regions. By combining interactive visualizations, search filters, and regional analytics, the app makes navigating complex relocation data both intuitive and engaging. The goal of the project is to simplify the complex relocation process and provide users with an intuitive and interactive experience.
