# Welcome to Moving Planner 
## _Find the best places to live, based on what matters to you._


## Description
The **Collaborative Moving Planner** feature allows multiple users within a group to jointly curate and evaluate a list of preferred counties or ZIP codes. These shared preferences can be visualized on an interactive U.S. county map and voted on by group members.

## How It Works
- **Group Management**: Users can create, join, or leave groups using the existing backend endpoints (`create_group.php`, `join_groups.php`, `leave_group.php`).
- **Shared Favorites**: Group members can add or remove shared favorites (`add_favorite.php`, `remove_group_favorite.php`, `remove_group_favorites.php`).
- **Visualization**: The `Usa_counties_large.svg` file is used to display group favorites on an interactive map.
- **Ranked Results**: Existing endpoints (`results.php`, `top5.php`) generate ranked lists of preferred regions for group discussion.

## Value
This feature transforms Moving Masters from a **solo research tool** into a **collaborative decision-making platform**, perfect for:
- Families planning a move together
- Friends relocating to the same area
- Teams or corporate relocation programs

## Example Workflow
1. A family creates a group.
2. Members search for regions using `search.php` and `zipcode_lookup.php`.
3. Each member adds promising ZIP codes or counties to the shared favorites list.
4. The group views all shared favorites on the map (`Usa_counties_large.svg`).
5. Members vote or discuss the top recommendations generated by `top5.php`.
